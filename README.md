# Python Rest API
 - Written in Python 3.9.5
 - RESTful API

### Implementations
Using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) Micro Web Framework
- **Flask** helps to facilitate the development of a web application with the included modules available. Flask is based on WSGI(Web Server Gateway Interface) toolkit and Jinja2 template engine.

Using [SQL Alchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) for ORM
- **SQLAlchemy** is a library that facilitates the communication between Python programs and databases. Most of the times, this library is used as an [Object Relational Mapper (ORM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) tool that translates Python classes to tables on relational databases and automatically converts function calls to SQL statements. 

Using [Marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for data serialization
- **Marshmallow** is an ORM/ODM/framework-agnostic library for converting complex datatypes, such as objects, to and from native Python datatypes.
